# breast-cancer-diagnosis-classification
Breast cancer diagnosis classification written in Python. 
This is a university project that I made.
I found the data on Kaggle.
The main objective of this project is to classificate the diagnosis of breast cancer for each patient.
0 stands for benign and 1 stands for malignant.
